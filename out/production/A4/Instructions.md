# Assignment 5:  DIY Calculator

_Note: These instructions contain formatting that does not render nicely in raw text formats (e.g., TextEdit or Notepad).  VSCode offers a markdown viewer window that will format the text for you._

In this assignment, you will practice using stacks in a real parsing application: computing the result of arithmetic expressions. To start, you will read an expression in postfix notation (e.g. `3 2 + 5 *`) and use an `ArrayDeque` as a stack to compute the result. In the end, you will build a calculator that can handle both infix (what we’re all accustomed to) and postfix notations.

In addition to stacks, we'll also use queues for passing tokens between different parts of our program.

## Specifications

Your first program will read a postfix expression from the command line and compute the result:

	java Postfix "3 2 + 5 *"
	Answer: 25
    
Your second program will read an infix expression from the command line and compute the result:

	java Calculate "(3+2)*5"
	Answer: 25

_Note: The quotation marks are required because the parentheses would otherwise be interpreted by the command line shell rather than being passed to your program as input.._

### Stack and Queue Implementations
For this assignment, we will use instances of the Java built-in `ArrayDeque` class (see [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html)) to serve as either a stack or a queue. Although we will be using the same underlying implementation for both, we will be using some objects only as queues and other objects only as stacks. To help keep things from getting confusing, we recommend naming your variables like this:

 - `ArrayDeque<Object> stack`: we'll make use of the `addFirst(...)` and `removeFirst()` methods to use this one as a **stack**
- `ArrayDeque<Object> queue`: we'll make use of the `addLast(...)` and `removeFirst()` methods to use this one as a **queue**

_**Warning**: Java also has a now-obsolete `Stack` class (see [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Stack.html)) but we do not endorse using it for this assignment, or really anything else. If you want to get into the details of why this is, check out [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-deque-vs-stack)._

### The `instanceof` operator
Additionally, both the stack and the token queue will need to hold data of heterogeneous types: `Double` for the numbers, and `Character` for the operators. This means that when you take an element off the queue or the stack, you'll need to determine what type it has: to accomplish this, use the `instanceof` operator.  For example,  `x instanceof Character` has the value `true` if `x` is of type `Character`.  Likewise, `x instanceof Double` has the value `true` if `x` is of type `Double`.

## Phase 1: Tokenization
Since we will be reading the expression from the command line arguments, it will originally be read in as a `String`. We can convert this to a series of discrete tokens using a `Scanner` that reads its input from a `StringReader` (see the `StringReader`  [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/StringReader.html)).

Once we set the delimiters properly, this `Scanner` will be able to separate numbers, operators, parentheses, etc.. If we put them into a queue, we can operate on them one at a time. You may want to play around with setting up this kind of `Scanner` in `Main.java` to make sure you understand how it works before moving on to Phase 1.

Included, you will find code for a `Tokenizer` that provides an example of how to use a ‘Scanner’ with a ‘StringReader’. We suggest using this code as a foundation and building on it to allow your calculator to read in postfix (phase 2) and infix (phase 3) strings.

## Phase 2: Postfix Computation 
![HP "No Equals" hat](Hewlett-Packard_No_Equals_hat.jpg "Title")

For Phase 2, you will join the "No Equals" team (see the vintage Hewlett Packard postfix-enthusiast hat in the photo above) and use `Postfix.java` to calculate the solution to a postfix equation. For example, "3 2 + 5 \*" corresponds to (3+2)\*5 in our standard infix notation. 

You would call it like this:

	java Postfix "3 2 + 5 *"

Then, the first step in processing the input expression will be to read its tokens and store them in a queue (see Phase 0 above).  Once you have done that, use the algorithm below to compute the value of the postfix expression:

* Take a token one at a time from the queue and process it as follows:
  * If the token is a **number**, `push(...)` it onto the stack
  * If the token is an **operator**, `pop()` two numbers off the stack, combine them using the **operator**, and `push(...)` the result back onto the stack
* Once all the tokens have been processed in this way, the stack should contain exactly one element: the result.

If the stack runs out of elements needed for processing an operator, or if there are too many items on the stack at the end, then the starting expression was malformed and you should throw an exception to report the error.

You should begin with a postfix calculator program named `Postfix.java`, then implement the more complicated algorithm below.

## Phase 3: Infix Computation
Handling infix expressions is more complicated because you have to deal with parentheses. However, infix expressions can be converted (parentheses and all) into postfix ones using a single stack. You can add the converted symbols to a queue as the conversion proceeds. The symbols in the queue may then be converted to a final value using the postfix expression algorithm you wrote previously. If you wrote your code for phase 1 correctly, you should be able to just call the appropriate method without any changes.  ‘

The outline below is a simplified version (ignoring operator associativity) of the full shunting yard algorithm given on Wikipedia: [Shunting-yard algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shunting-yard_algorithm&oldid=572362024).

_Note: to follow this implementation, you will need **two** instances of type `ArrayDeque<Object>`: one that will operate as a stack, and another that will operate as a queue._

* While there are tokens to be read:

  * Read a token.

  * If the token is a number, then add it to the output queue.

  * If the token is an operator (the "queue operator") then:

	* while there is an operator token at the top of the stack (the "stack operator"), and the stack operator has GREATER THAN OR EQUAL  precedence than the queue operator,

  	* pop the stack operator off the stack and add it to the output queue;

	* when no more high-precedence stack operators remain, finally push the queue operator onto the stack.

  * If the token is a left parenthesis, then push it onto the stack.

  * If the token is a right parenthesis:
	* Until the token at the top of the stack is a left parenthesis, pop operators off the stack onto the output queue.

	* Pop the left parenthesis from the stack, but not onto the output queue.

	* If the stack runs out without finding a left parenthesis, then there are mismatched parentheses.

* When there are no more tokens to read:
  * While there are still tokens in the stack:
	* If the token on the top of the stack is a parenthesis, then there are mismatched parentheses.

	* If it is an operator, pop it onto the output queue.
* Exit.

Once this is implemented, you should be able to send the now-populated output queue directly to your postfix-processing method in `Postfix.java` to compute the result of an infix equation that uses parentheses as well as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` 

### Left- vs. Right-Associativity
The shunting-yard pseudocode given above will work for the operators `+` `-` `*` and `/` but not for `^` (exponentiation). While the first four operators are left-associative, the latter is right-associative and therefore needs slightly different treatment.

What does left-associative mean? We interpret 1+2+3 as (1+2)+3. On the other hand, 2^1^3 is interpreted as 2^(1^3) because ^ is right-associative. For full credit your program should implement the complete shunting-yard algorithm linked above from Wikipedia, including associativity.  This approach will involve only a small change from the simplified algorithm shown above.

The strategy for implementing left-associative operations is described in the full Shunting-Yard pseudocode under the Wikipedia link, but it boils down to using less than in the precedence comparison rather than less than or equal to.
